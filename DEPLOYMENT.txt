STUDENT REGISTRATION SYSTEM - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
===============================================

Your project is now ready for deployment! Here's how to get live links:

=== STEP 1: SETUP MONGODB ATLAS (Required for Backend) ===
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new cluster (choose free tier)
4. Create a database user (username + password)
5. Whitelist all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) in Network Access
6. Get your connection string (looks like: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/student)

=== STEP 2: DEPLOY BACKEND TO RENDER ===
1. Go to https://render.com and sign up (connect your GitHub account)
2. Push your code to GitHub first
3. Create New > Web Service
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure:
   - Name: student-registration-backend
   - Root Directory: backend
   - Environment: Node
   - Build Command: npm install
   - Start Command: npm start
6. Add Environment Variables:
   - MONGO_URI = your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   - PORT = 5000
   - EMAIL_HOST = smtp.gmail.com
   - EMAIL_PORT = 587
   - EMAIL_USER = your_email@gmail.com
   - EMAIL_PASS = your_app_password
7. Click "Create Web Service"
8. Copy your backend URL (e.g., https://student-registration-backend.onrender.com)

=== STEP 3: DEPLOY FRONTEND TO VERCEL ===
1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign up (connect your GitHub account)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: Create React App
   - Root Directory: frontend
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: build
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - REACT_APP_API_URL = your_backend_url_from_step2
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Copy your frontend URL (e.g., https://student-registration.vercel.app)

=== ALTERNATIVE: DEPLOY FRONTEND TO NETLIFY ===
1. Go to https://netlify.com and sign up
2. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to GitHub and select your repository
4. Configure:
   - Base directory: frontend
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: frontend/build
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - REACT_APP_API_URL = your_backend_url_from_step2
6. Click "Deploy site"
7. Copy your frontend URL (e.g., https://student-registration.netlify.app)

=== STEP 4: PUSH TO GITHUB ===
1. Open terminal in your project folder
2. Run these commands:
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   git push -u origin main

=== YOUR LIVE LINKS WILL BE: ===
- Frontend: https://your-app-name.vercel.app (or .netlify.app)
- Backend API: https://your-app-name.onrender.com

=== IMPORTANT NOTES: ===
1. Update frontend/.env.production with your actual backend URL after deploying
2. Render free tier may sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity (first request takes ~30 seconds)
3. Make sure to use MongoDB Atlas, not local MongoDB
4. Keep your .env files secure and never commit them to GitHub
5. For Gmail email service, you need to enable "App Passwords" in your Google account

=== TESTING YOUR DEPLOYMENT: ===
1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Register a student
4. Check if email notifications work
5. Approve/reject students

Good luck with your deployment! 🚀
